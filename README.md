# 🎲 TOR - The One Randomizer 
Fast access to your's Random Tables

## Why

TOR was created to **speed up and simplify rolling on random tables** used in tabletop role-playing games – such as events, encounters, locations, or NPC descriptions.

Instead of flipping through spreadsheets and rolling dice by hand, you can get results **in seconds**.

It’s especially useful for:

- Solo players  
- Game Masters 

to event-driven campaigns with lots of random events  

You can use **ready-made tables** or **create your own**, and organize them exactly the way you need:
by campaign, by session, by theme, or by rulebook.

The goal is simple:  
**Less search, fast roll, fewer interruptions, more time to play, more immersion.**

## How

The app runs in a **clean, text-based terminal interface (TUI)**. 

1. You create **libraries** (collections of tables)  
2. You add **your own or pre-made tables**  
3. You group them however you like:
   - by campaign  
   - by session  
   - by theme (horror, fantasy, sci-fi)  
   - by sourcebook or ruleset  

Then:

4. Select a library and a table  
5. Press a key to roll  
6. Instantly see the result in a pop-up window
